OpenAI's GPT-3 is now available for public beta, so I went ahead and decided to try it out.   
  
<h1>Background</h1>  
  
GPT-2 Was another product of openAI, which used many neural networks to generate fake, but compelling texts.  
  
  
<h1>Demo of GPT-2</h1>  
Here's an example with the input 'Pebble Technology Corp.', a Technology corporation who met their demise when Fitbit bought them in 2016.  
  
```  
GPT-2 Generated:  
Pebble Technology Corp. (NYSE: CBT) announced its first foray into blockchain startups on Monday.  
  
B2B Capital raised $17.7 million from a venture capital firm set up to help the company tap into bitcoin-infused cash.  
  
The company will be the fifth such venture backed by BBB Capital as the company brings its services to bitcoin startups on the block, following Blockstream and Chain 2X.  
  
"It's the first blockchain startup I've ever joined, because, really, it's really great," said David Hirsch, senior vice president of blockchain at B2B Capital.  
  
Hirsch pointed to the growing visibility of bitcoin businesses across the globe and says all businesses have to play a role to get ahead in the money market. For instance, Hirsch says there are now more than 100 bitcoin businesses with $500 million in annual revenue, that include Bitpay and eCheck, as well as Blockstream and Chain 2X.  
  
The company launched its first two bitcoin businesses last year in Hong Kong and Singapore, where it currently serves merchants seeking a financial services platform. It now operates in all 50 states and has over 350 locations across the US and over 70 markets worldwide.  
  
The company first came up with the idea of blockchain in August, with founder Roger Ver announcing it early last year.  
```  
  
Now, Obviously Pebble is *not* a blockchain startup. But, give anyone who doesn't know what pebble is, and they probably will believe it.  
  
<h2>GPT-3 Comparison</h2>  
GPT-3 on the other hand, gets *actual* data from the world. It's scary how accurate it is. Here's the same input with GPT-3.  
  
```  
GPT-3 Generated:  
Pebble Technology Corp. is a developer of wearable technology, primarily smartwatches. The company's flagship product, the Pebble smartwatch, is a customizable device that can connect to a user's smartphone to provide notifications and other functionality. Pebble also offers a development platform for third-party developers to create applications for its devices. The company was founded in 2012 and is based in Palo Alto, California.  
```  
  
Now, this is something that's actually true, with perfect grammar, and data from the real world. It gets really scary when you give GPT-3 an *actual* real-world topic, where it generates very compelling articles that flat-out aren't true. I'll show one, but OpenAI asks that anything marked as 'Sensitive' to not be shown on social media, so I'll abide by those guidelines.  
  
I'll give the input 'Apple and Right To Repair', because I am for sure not putting any news headlines in this thing and share them here, as that would be a pretty terrible idea.  
  
Here's the generated text:  
  
```  
GPT-3 Generated:  

**Apple and Right To Repair   
**Apple has a history of opposing right to repair laws. In 2018, the company lobbied against a Nebraska bill that would have allowed consumers and third-party repair shops to fix Apple products. The company argued that the legislation would make it difficult to protect users from harmful malware.The bill ultimately failed to pass.   
  
Apple**'s stance on right to repair  
  
**Apple has consistently opposed right to repair legislation, arguing that it would make it difficult to protect users from harmful malware. In 2018, the company lobbied against a Nebraska bill that would have allowed consumers and third-party repair shops to fix Apple products.  
  

**Apple's history with their IRP program  
  
**Apple introduced their IRP program in 2017. The program allows authorized third-party repair shops to fix Apple products. The program was initially met with criticism from independent repair shops, who argued that the program was too restrictive. However, the program has been revised and expanded in response to these criticisms.  
  

**Louis Rossman**'s experience with AppleIn 2018, independent repair shop owner Louis Rossman published a video criticizing Apple's repair policies. Rossman argued that Apple's policies make it difficult for independent repair shops to fix Apple products. He also accused the company of using " scare tactics " to discourage consumers from using independent repair shops  
```  
  
I gave GPT-3 everything in bold. It's scary how accurate this text is, and GPT-4 will ***most likely*** be closed to the public, if GPT-3 is this good at text generation.  
  
<h2>Conclusion</h2>  
  
My experience with GPT-2, and GPT-3 and the jump in-between has shown me that not only is AI growing at an *incredibly* fast rate, (In fact, the time distance between GPT-2 and GPT-3 isn't that long.) and AI can certainly advance more than this with GPT-4, and I have no doubt about it.   
  
With these new AI advancements however, comes great risk for more fake topics being discussed (I'm not discussing the news-side of this, just the tech :) ), so any company can login to GPT-3 and create a brand new fake product in minutes, and get thousands if not millions of people to buy it. OpenAI is currently working on a Content Filter however, so soon these topics will be prevented from generating.  
  
In conclusion: AI is cool, just use it in the right ways.

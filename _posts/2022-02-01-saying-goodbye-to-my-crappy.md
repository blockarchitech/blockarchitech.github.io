I finally decided to customize my laptop, and actually do something with my crappy, slow ZSH shell.   

<h1>ZSH Framework</h1>
  
First of all, I went with Pretzo for my ZSH framework. It's fast, customizable and has a great user base - meaning more updates and good support.  
  
One of the amazing features of Pretzo is it's themes. Unlike anything else (except for ZSH For Humans, more on that later) it's themes doesn't slow anything down, and it has modules, on of which I use is the git module which is (so far) the best terminal-git integration I've tried. I actually mainly use git from the command line, which is why it's crucial for me to have a good terminal for that. Another thing I really love about pretzo is how snappy it is. Sometimes it can be a bit slow, so I do have a pretty light installation, but it's fast, and preforming basic tasks is extremely fast with pretzo.  
  
<h1>Terminal</h1>

Then, it's time for the terminal itself. macOS's built in terminal is lacking. One of the great things I love about Windows Terminal is Tabs. It's super seamless, and it's exactly like chrome but for terminals. (Yes, exactly. Eats ram like it's candy.) So, I decided to go with iTerm2, with one of the core features being tabs. In fact, you can have tabs, inside of tabs. So I can have 3 terminals on one tab, and another 3 terminals on another tab. Please note, this is 6 terminals. I don't know anybody in their right mind who would need 6 terminals at once, but hey, if you really wanted to, it's there.   
  
Another thing I LOVE about iTerm2, is that it takes little to no system resources even with 8+ terminals open. It depends on what you're doing in the terminals, but iTerm2 itself takes up almost nothing resources-wise, which is also crucial for my MacBook that only has a Dual-Core CPU. This makes iTerm incredibly fast, also. Yet another thing are color palettes. You can make your own color pallet, or just do what I did and import a theme.  
  
The whole thing came together amazing, and here's the final result: https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/si64cv/amethystmacos_finally_happy_with_this_purple/  
  
If anyone has any ideas for it, let me know! Would love to see what you think.
